	<h1>View event types</h1>
	<p>This tab is used for viewing all existing event types.</p>
	<p>Event types are draggable. By dragging and dropping an event type (e.g. Sports) onto a map, you will initialize the process of creating a new event that is of the selected event type (Sports). The location of that event will correspond to where you dropped the event type onto the map.</p>
	<p>By left-clicking the <i>Remove</i> button at the bottom of the window, the event type corresponding to the selected row will be removed if no events of that type already exist.</p>
